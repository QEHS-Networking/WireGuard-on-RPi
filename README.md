# WireGuard-on-RPi
WireGuard Lessons on a Raspberry Pi for encryption a Home-based network & Cell Phone based-VPN

**Purpose**: introduction to Cyber Security (Home-based or small networks) using industry-level Linux based encryption for IP Devices within a LAN and device encryptions (VPN-like) for outside a LAN-Router
- Use a Raspberry Pi to create encryption device for router, interior-host, and exterior-device (Cell Phone) communication (i.e. monitoring cameras using IP Addresses)
- Use a Raspberry Pi to create a home-based VPN to encrypt and re-route data communication in questionable environments
- CAUTION: these lessons are meant for education purposes and not completely secure solutions

Note: this project introduces students to all concepts and ideas for <a href="http://www.nait.ca/program_home_78547.htm">NAIT's BAIST Program</a>

# Why do we use Wire-Guard in Mercer's Kitchen

Summary
- Able to access all computers through one port, anything with IP Address (includes IP Cameras, etc.)
- WireGuard is same program on Client or Server side, configurations are different
- WireGuard is actually very simple ... May take a few weeks the first time but afterwards will take 15 minutes to set up a new installation

# Hardware Setup - Initial Setup Only

RPi 3 with Current OS, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/RPi-Unboxing">Click Here for unboxing Repository in Mercer's Kitchen</a>

RPi File Configuration
- Big Idea: use NANO (RPi, Linux-based text editor)
